## 🧠 How Mood Mapping Works

API-Ninjas provides **category-based quotes**, not emotion-based.  
To ensure consistency, each mood is **locked to one category**.

| Mood | API Category |
|----|-------------|
| Happy | `hope` |
| Sad | `failure` |
| Motivation | `success` |
| Wisdom | `wisdom` |

This guarantees that:
- Quotes remain relevant to the selected mood
- No random category mixing occurs
